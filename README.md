===

You can view detailed Trello Boards and export them to HTML (Save Page doesn't
work). An ideal use for this is to generate and print weekly/monthly reports (at
least that is how our team uses it.) Another use of this app is to directly 
append a board id to the hash, for example, the report for the official Trello
Development is http://tianshuo.github.com/trello/#4d5ea62fd76aa1136000000c

The hosted version is on http://tianshuo.github.com/trello/ At the present moment,
only Chrome is supported. (I haven't tested firefox yet)

There is also a blog article on this:
